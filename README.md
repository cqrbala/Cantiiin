# Project Phase 4 : Collaborators - Balakumar, Haran, Arnav 

# Project Overview

Our database tries to encapusulate the food situation on campus, from the different messes and canteens, to a students likes and dislikes, and so on. In the project’s final phase, we were made to set up the database in mysql, populate the database and finally develop a python CLI tool to interface with the mysql database. 

Using the python CLI we were able to implement a variety of commands that the user can perform on our database. The commands were divided into 4 subsections : `Update,Insert,Delete and Functional Queries`. 

The following is the overview of each of the commands implemented
